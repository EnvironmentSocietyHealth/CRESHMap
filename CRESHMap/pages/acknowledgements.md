The web map was developed through funding provided through two sources&#58;

1. the SPECTRUM Consortium, funded by the UK Prevention Research Partnership (UKPRP), a multi-funder initiative that supports novel research into the primary prevention of non-communicable diseases to improve population health and reduce health inequalities. The Medical Research Council is the administrator of this grant under grant reference (MR/S037519/1).
