title: Acknowledgements

Feedback from the [CRESH team](https://cresh.org.uk/people/), Jenn Ruddick (AFS), Aidan Collins (AFS) and Megan McNicol (NHS Analytical Exchange Programme 2017) facilitated the development of the app. The app was built in Rstudio (0.98.507) with support from the R user community. In particular the guides written by Dean Attali were invaluable. We acknowledge that the data on alcohol outlets were kindly supplied by representatives from each of the local authorities. We would also like to acknowledge the support from the following organisations.
